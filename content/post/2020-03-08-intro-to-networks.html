<div id="converting-the-edge-data-frame" class="section level1">
<h1>Converting the edge data frame</h1>
<p>In order to convert the dataframe we use <code>tidygraph::as_tbl_graph()</code>. This will convert our simple edge list into a tidygraph object.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tidy_basic &lt;- basic %&gt;% 
  as_tbl_graph()</code></pre>
<p>The tidygraph object is two dataframes connected the nodes (each point) and edge (each connection).</p>
<pre><code>## # A tbl_graph: 6 nodes and 6 edges
## #
## # A directed acyclic simple graph with 1 component
## #
## # Node Data: 6 x 1 (active)
##   name 
##   &lt;chr&gt;
## 1 1    
## 2 2    
## 3 3    
## 4 4    
## 5 5    
## 6 6    
## #
## # Edge Data: 6 x 2
##    from    to
##   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;
## 1     1     2
## 2     1     3
## 3     2     4
## # … with 3 more rows</code></pre>
<p>In order to manipulate the tbl_graph we need to tell R which of the two data frames we want to opperate on. This is done with <code>activate(nodes)</code> or <code>activate(edges)</code>. Here we will name each node with a letter, and give each edge a random amount of transparency.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tidy_basic_manipulated &lt;- tidy_basic %&gt;% 
  activate(nodes) %&gt;%              # tell tidygraph we want to work on the modes dataframe
  mutate(id = letters[1:6]) %&gt;%    # adding an id column for each node a - f
  activate(edges) %&gt;%              # tell tidygraph we want to work on the edge dataframe
  mutate(alpha = runif(6, min = 0, max = 1)) # give each edge a random transparency value</code></pre>
<p>Let’s look at the columns we added to the plot.</p>
<pre><code>## # A tbl_graph: 6 nodes and 6 edges
## #
## # A directed acyclic simple graph with 1 component
## #
## # Edge Data: 6 x 3 (active)
##    from    to alpha
##   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     1     2 0.594
## 2     1     3 0.761
## 3     2     4 0.621
## 4     3     4 0.890
## 5     4     5 0.621
## 6     5     6 0.297

## # Node Data: 6 x 2
##   name  id   
##   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;
## 1 1     a    
## 2 2     b    
## 3 3     c    
## # … with 3 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Some quick plotting using ggraph. We will delve into this a bit more later. We need to specify the layout, and we need to give both the nodes and edges a <code>geom</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggraph(tidy_basic_manipulated, layout = &#39;sugiyama&#39;)+
  geom_edge_link  (aes(alpha = alpha)) +
  geom_node_point (aes(color = id)) + 
  geom_node_text  (aes(label = id), repel = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-03-08-intro-to-networks_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" />
Great we created a simple edge list, made it into a tidy graph object, manipulated it, then plotted it. Next we will step up the complexity but still</p>
</div>
<div id="a-slightly-more-complex-example" class="section level1">
<h1>A slightly more complex example</h1>
<p>Lets look a the highschool dataset from <code>ggraph</code>. Now this data has a yearly component, we’ll get to that part but for now lets stick to one year for simplicity.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hs_tidy &lt;- highschool %&gt;% 
  filter(year == 1957) %&gt;% # remove the time component for this example
  select(-year) %&gt;% 
  as_tbl_graph()</code></pre>
<p>And lets plot it real quick.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggraph(hs_tidy, layout = &quot;stress&quot;) +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_edge_link()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-03-08-intro-to-networks_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now that we have the data into tidygraph’s tbl_graph object we can easily calculate many statistical measures for each node edge easily combining <code>activate()</code> and <code>mutate()</code>. There are quite a few centrality measures a full list can be found <a href="https://rdrr.io/cran/tidygraph/man/centrality.html">HERE</a>. Thankfully tidygraph gives us nice clean wrappers for all the centrality measures created in <code>igraph</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hs_manipulated &lt;- hs_tidy %&gt;% 
  activate(nodes) %&gt;% 
  mutate(  
    # calculate various centrality measures
    central_alpha  = centrality_alpha(), 
    central_degree = centrality_degree(),
    # calculate various grouping/clustering measures
    components     = as.factor(group_components()), 
    walktrap       = as.factor(group_walktrap()) 
  ) %&gt;%    
  activate(edges) %&gt;% 
  mutate(  # calculate edge centrality
    weight =  centrality_edge_betweenness()
  )</code></pre>
<p>Let’s take a look at our new metrics</p>
<pre><code>## # A tbl_graph: 70 nodes and 243 edges
## #
## # A directed simple graph with 2 components
## #
## # Node Data: 70 x 5 (active)
##   name  central_alpha central_degree components walktrap

## 3 3             1                  2 1          1       
## 4 4            -1.33               4 2          2       
## 5 5            -0.333              2 2          2

## 2     1    14   8.33
## 3     1    20   2.98
## # … with 240 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Let’s plot it and specify aesthetics based off the metrics we calculated.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggraph(hs_manipulated, layout = &#39;stress&#39;) +
  geom_node_point(aes(color = walktrap,
                      size = central_alpha)) +
  geom_edge_link (aes(alpha = weight))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-03-08-intro-to-networks_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now</p>
<pre class="r"><code>a &lt;- ggraph(hs_manipulated, layout = &quot;kk&quot;) +

<div id="use-networkd3-to-make-a-more-detailed-plot" class="section level1">
<h1>Use networkD3 to make a more detailed plot</h1>
<p>So, unfortunatly Networkd3 does not play nicley direcly with tidygraph so we need to do some conversions. First we need to convert our tidygraph object to a network d3 object using <code>igraph_to_networkD3()</code>. In order to specify the group each nodes belongs in we need to extract a named vector to specify the <code>group =</code> argument. Then we need to create our Javascript color scale.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>group_information &lt;- hs_manipulated %&gt;% 
  activate(nodes) %&gt;% 
  as_tibble() 

node_vec &lt;- as.numeric(group_information[[&quot;name&quot;]])

group_info &lt;- set_names(x = group_vec, nm = node_vec)

# Convert igraph to list for networkD3
d3_object &lt;- igraph_to_networkD3(hs_manipulated, group = group_info)

# Set the colors for d3 orange and blue for now
ColourScale &lt;- &#39;d3.scaleOrdinal()
